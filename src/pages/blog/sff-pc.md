# My new mini ITX PC.

### FormD T1

I don't think it's uncommon for ITX builds to start with choosing a case. I went with the FormD T1 V2, at just 9.95L in volume, it's about as small as you can go without impacting performance in any significant way. It also just looks super clean and minimal in black, which I really like, and is made for a sandwich layout.

The unique thing about this case is that it ships as a flatpack, meaning you have to assemble it yourself, whilst this makes the build process a bit more difficult and time consuming than most other cases, it gives you a lot more options to configure the case. I also have to mention how premium it feels, each piece metal just feels sturdy, light, and just has an amazing finish to it.

### AMD Ryzen 7 7700X

The 7700X just seemed to be the right fit for me, it strikes a middle ground between great gaming performance and also being able to handle production workloads very well. Since I'm just a hobbyist when it comes to video editing, 3D rendering & game-development, etc. I didn't feel like the need to go for one of the workstation CPU's like the 7900X / 7950X.

### NVIDIA RTX 4080 Founders Edition

This card has been slated a bit for it's poor value due to pricing, but here in the UK I felt like there was no other option for this performance tier. The competing AMD 7900 XTX is pretty much the same price (and in some cases more expensive) and it would mean missing out on the benefits that going with an Nvidia GPU gives you, such as Ray tracing, DLSS, CUDA, etc.

### Asus ROG STRIX B650E-I

Not much to say about this one, there aren't many AM5 ITX motherboards on the market right now, this is just one of the more solid options.

### Phanteks Glacier One

I went for this AIO for a few reasons, it's AM5 compatible, it has a low profile CPU pump block (which is great for a sandwich case like this), and most importantly, it looks cool.

### G.Skill Ripjaws DDR5-6000 CL30

6000Mhz is the sweet spot for AM5. This was the lowest latency set I could find for a good price.

### Samsung 980 Pro 2TB M.2

A solid M.2 drive that doesn't break the bank. This motherboard actually supports two M.2 drives so I'd like to add another in the future.

### Corsair SF750

Tried and tested PSU for ITX builds. 750W Platinum is more than enough to power this build. It comes with some great cables too. The Silverstone Extreme 850R is also an option if you need something a bit more powerful, though I've seen 4090 builds that do just fine with the Corsair.

### Case Fans (Noctua A12x15 + Phanteks T30)

The reason for the mismatched fans is to make use of the extra space on the PSU side. The motherboard side only has enough room for a slim fan, these two are some of the best performers on the market.

## Conclusion

I'm supper happy with how this build turned out. It's the smallest PC I've ever built, and yet still the most powerful. It meets all of my performance needs and I'm having no issue with temperatures or noise levels. The FormD T1 was surprisingly easy to build in, and I've had more headaches building in larger mATX cases. However, cable management was very challenging and I'm not totally satisfied with it. I'm considering getting a set of custom length unsleeved / silicone cables in the future for a cleaner look.
